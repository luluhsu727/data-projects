# Energy Market Data Analysis Report

## Background
As part of the research division focused on big data analysis of renewable energy transactions, the Energy Statistics Database provides insights into global energy production, trade, and consumption. The dataset spans from 1990 and aims to inform a technical assistance project in partnership with a selected country. The analysis primarily focuses on solar and wind energy production across various countries, with the intention to guide future energy policies.

## Objectives
- Analyze trends in solar and wind energy production.
- Identify key players in renewable energy production.
- Use KMeans clustering to categorize countries based on energy production patterns.
- Focus on renewable energy markets in the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and Israel.
- Explore the contribution of various energy types and identify energy imbalances.

## Key Findings

### Renewable Energy Trends (Solar and Wind)
- **Leading Producers:** The United States, Germany, China, Israel, and Turkey are significant producers of wind and solar energy.
- **Fluctuations Post-2010:** Production of solar and wind energy has seen notable fluctuations, particularly after 2010.

### Top Producers of Wind and Solar Energy
- **United States and Germany** lead in renewable energy production, with the U.S. being a top producer of wind energy in recent years.
- **China and Germany** contribute substantially but have different energy consumption patterns compared to other countries.

### KMeans Clustering
- Countries were clustered into four groups based on their energy production trends:
  - **Cluster 0:** Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada – diverse energy production, including both renewable and conventional sources.
  - **Cluster 1:** Germany, Israel, Turkey – focus on renewable energy, especially wind and solar.
  - **Cluster 2:** Japan – substantial reliance on solar, nuclear, and other energy types.
  - **Cluster 3:** United States – leading in wind energy production with contributions from solar and conventional energy sources.

### Energy Type Distribution and Imbalances
- **Energy Imbalance in the UK:** Despite increasing renewable energy production, hard coal and brown coal remain dominant energy sources in the UK, especially after 2015.
- **Shifting Trends:** The UK has moved towards renewable energy and natural gas, although coal remains a key part of the energy mix.

### Energy Category Analysis for the United Kingdom
- **Dominance of Conventional Energy:** The UK’s energy mix is still heavily reliant on coal and natural gas, with some contributions from nuclear and renewable energy.
- **Renewable Growth:** Despite growth, renewables face challenges in competing with established energy sources like coal and gas.

## Conclusion
The analysis shows a clear trend towards renewable energy, with solar and wind gaining ground in countries like Germany, Israel, and the U.S. However, the transition is not uniform, as countries like the UK continue to rely on traditional energy sources. Clustering analysis reveals distinct energy production and consumption patterns, which can help tailor technical assistance projects for more effective energy market development.

## Recommendations for the Technical Assistance Project
1. **Focus on High Renewable Energy Clusters:** Partner with countries in **Cluster 1 (Germany, Israel, Turkey)** and **Cluster 3 (United States)** to strengthen their renewable energy initiatives.
2. **Support Transition Countries (e.g., UK, China):** Provide strategies for countries transitioning from conventional energy sources to renewables.
3. **Invest in Renewable Energy Market Development:** Focus on emerging markets with potential for growth in renewable energy production.
4. **Address Energy Imbalances:** Develop strategies to balance the adoption of renewable energy while managing the decline of conventional energy sources.
