# Forecasting Wikipedia Pageviews - Figma (Software)

This project aims to forecast the daily Wikipedia pageviews of the "Figma (software)" article from 2022 onward using time series analysis and Facebook Prophet. The dataset displays weekly seasonality, a mild upward trend, and occasional anomalies. Our approach involves:

* Visualising the data
* Handling anomalies
* Fitting a time series forecasting model
* Making and visualising predictions

* Source traffic where we predict the future traffic[https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/?project=en.wikipedia.org&platform=all-access&agent=user&redirects=0&start=2022-01-01&end=2022-08-23&pages=Figma_(software)]
