    "* A company builds Android and iOS mobile apps that are available on Google Play and in the App Store. All apps built are **free** to download and install for English-speaking audience. The main source of revenue of A company consists of **in-app ads**. This means the more users who see and engage with the ads, the better.\n",

    "* The aim of the project is to analyse data to help the developers understand what type of apps are likely to attract more users.\n",

    "Although we note a few outliers skewing the result, just like the other two genres. **This genre shows more potential if we can take another popular book and turn it into something that add-on features (like an audio version of the book, embedding the book with a dictionary so the readers do not need to exit the app).** This idea seems to fit well with the fact that the App Store is dominated by for-fun apps. This suggests the market might be a bit saturated with for-fun apps, which means a practical app might have more of a chance to stand out among the huge number of apps on the App Store.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other genres that seem popular include weather, book, food and drink, or finance. The book genre seem to overlap a bit with the app idea we described above, but the other genres don't seem too interesting to us:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Weather apps — people generally don't spend too much time in-app, and the chances of making profit from in-app adds are low. Also, getting reliable live weather data may require us to connect our apps to non-free APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Food and drink — examples here include Starbucks, Dunkin' Donuts, McDonald's, etc. So making a popular food and drink app requires actual cooking and a delivery service, which is outside the scope of our company.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Finance apps — these apps involve banking, paying bills, money transfer, etc. Building a finance app requires domain knowledge, and we don't want to hire a finance expert just to build an app.\n",

    "## Most Popular Apps by Genre on Google Play - Method \n",
    "\n",
    "We have come up with app profile recommendations for the App Store based on the number of user ratings. However for Googleplay, we actually have data about the exact number of installs per app which should provide a clearer picture about genre popularity. The only downside is, the install numbers do not seem precise enough, as we can see that most values are open-ended (100+, 1,000+, 5,000+, etc.):\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-2.png](attachment:image-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It remains unclear whether an app with 100,000+ installs has 100,000 installs, 200,000, or 350,000. However, as we do not need very precise data for our purposes (we only want to find out which app genres attract the most users), this should not create a big problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a result, we will be leaving the numbers as they are, which means that we will consider that an app with 100,000+ installs has 100,000 installs, and an app with 1,000,000+ installs has 1,000,000 installs, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "To perform computations, however, **we will need to convert each install number from a string to a float. This means we need to remove the commas and the plus characters, or the conversion will fail and cause an error.**\n",
    "\n",
    "To remove characters from strings, we will be using the `str.replace(old, new)` method. We will replace the non-numerical characters with the empty string `''`:"
