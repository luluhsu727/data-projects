There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n\nAnalyzing the performance of schools is important for a variety of stakeholders, including policy and education professionals, researchers, government, and even parents considering which school their children should attend. \n\nYou have been provided with a dataset called `schools.csv`, which is previewed below.\n\nYou have been tasked with answering three key questions about New York City (NYC) public school SAT performance.","metadata":{},"id":"fe0ea788-58dd-459e-8976-fafdb5c05c6d","cell_type":"markdown"},{"source":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nprint(schools.head())\nprint(schools.columns)\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...\n\n# Check if there are any missing values and fill in with 0\nprint(schools.isna().any())\nschools.fillna(0, inplace=True)\n\n# Which NYC schools have the best math results?\nbest_math = schools[schools['average_math'] > 800 * 0.8]\nbest_math_schools = best_math[['school_name', 'average_math']].sort_values('average_math', ascending=False)\nprint(best_math_schools)\n\n# What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?\nschools['total_SAT'] = schools[['average_math', 'average_reading', 'average_writing']].sum(axis=1)\nschools_sort_SAT = schools.sort_values('total_SAT', ascending=False)\ntop_10 = schools_sort_SAT.iloc[0:10]\ntop_10_schools = top_10[['school_name', 'total_SAT']]\nprint(top_10_schools)\n\n# Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?\nborough_stats = schools.groupby('borough')['total_SAT'].agg(['count', 'mean', 'std']).round(2).reset_index()\nprint(borough_stats)\nborough_stats.columns = ['borough','num_schools', 'average_SAT', 'std_SAT']\nborough_stats_sort=borough_stats.sort_values('std_SAT',ascending=False)\nlargest_std_dev=borough_stats_sort.iloc[[0]]\nprint(largest_std_dev)\ntype(largest_std_dev)","metadata":{"id":"bA5ajAmk7XH6","executionTime":53,"lastSuccessfullyExecutedCode":"# Re-run this cell \nimport pandas as pd\n\n# Read in the data\nschools = pd.read_csv(\"schools.csv\")\n\n# Preview the data\nprint(schools.head())\nprint(schools.columns)\n\n# Start coding here...\n# Add as many cells as you like...\n\n# Check if there are any missing values and fill in with 0\nprint(schools.isna().any())\nschools.fillna(0, inplace=True)\n\n# Which NYC schools have the best math results?\nbest_math = schools[schools['average_math'] > 800 * 0.8]\nbest_math_schools = best_math[['school_name', 'average_math']].sort_values('average_math', ascending=False)\nprint(best_math_schools)\n\n# What are the top 10 performing schools based on the combined SAT scores?\nschools['total_SAT'] = schools[['average_math', 'average_reading', 'average_writing']].sum(axis=1)\nschools_sort_SAT = schools.sort_values('total_SAT', ascending=False)\ntop_10 = schools_sort_SAT.iloc[0:10]\ntop_10_schools = top_10[['school_name', 'total_SAT']]\nprint(top_10_schools)\n\n# Which single borough has the largest standard deviation in the combined SAT score?\nborough_stats = schools.groupby('borough')['total_SAT'].agg(['count', 'mean', 'std']).round(2).reset_index()\nprint(borough_stats)\nborough_stats.columns = ['borough','num_schools', 'average_SAT', 'std_SAT']\nborough_stats_sort=borough_stats.sort_values('std_SAT',ascending=False)\nlargest_std_dev=borough_stats_sort.iloc[[0]]\nprint(largest_std_dev)\ntype(largest_std_dev)","executionCancelledAt":null,"lastExecutedAt":1744844675096,"lastScheduledRunId":null,"outputsMetadata":{"0":{"height":521,"type":"stream"}},"lastExecutedByKernel":"d7487b22-b164-4817-9658-40385056d3d4"},"id":"d0eb4f16-5a99-460d-a5ba-706b7ef0bbe7","cell_type":"code","execution_count":39,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":"                                         school_name  ... percent_tested\n0  New Explorations into Science, Technology and ...  ...
